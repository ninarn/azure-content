# Customer Case Studies

  ![][8]

There are many big companies that depend on SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines for their data workloads. We work to provide customers with the service they require to keep their businesses running smoothly.

The UK movie and TV streaming service BlinkBox is enjoying terrific growth, but their London datacenter was a barrier to future growth. To quickly and cost-effectively gain access to the compute power and storage needed to perform video encoding, blinkbox moved to the cloud — specifically, Microsoft Azure. By moving to Azure and unplugging its datacenter, blinkbox will save millions of dollars, gain the ability to scale IT infrastructure on demand, and deliver a great customer experience on multiple consumer devices.

GE Healthcare, a division of General Electric, provides transformational medical technologies and services that are shaping a new age of patient care. The company wanted a more flexible, scalable platform for delivering applications healthcare providers worldwide rely on. To meet its goals, it pursued a cross-platform cloud strategy and decided to deploy multiple applications on Microsoft Azure.

Lufthansa Systems provides consulting and IT services and has a leading position in the global aviation industry, catering to more than 300 airlines and 150 customers from other industries. The company is upgrading its data center servers to the Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system and Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 to add multitenancy and self-service resource provisioning to its private cloud. Windows Azure augments its on-premises private cloud with public cloud resources for increased capacity and resilience.

SAFE is a security management platform for customers worldwide provided by the security and defense company Saab. The organization wanted to use SAFE for event security, and needed technology that could be quickly deployed and used to back up and restore customer data. SAFE was implemented on Microsoft Azure, using the Microsoft SQL Server Backup to Azure Tool, in order to back up data in minutes. It also offers fast deployment, eliminating the need for additional hardware, and scales to support thousands of users.

*"We know that if we lost our database, we would have it back up and running in a few minutes at most with SQL Server Backup to Azure. That is very compelling for our business."*

Toyota Motor Corporation has 16 websites that deliver more than 100 million page views per month. The company’s GAZOO.com site offers car owners—as well as Toyota employees and dealers—vehicle information, social networking, news, and entertainment. To enhance site content, increase scalability, and reduce the cost of ownership, Toyota is rebuilding the site using the Windows Azure cloud development environment and Microsoft SharePoint 2013.
